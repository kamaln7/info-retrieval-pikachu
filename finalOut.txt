In mathematics and computing, an algorithm is a procedure (a finite set of well-defined instructions) for accomplishing some task which, given an initial state, will terminate in a defined end-state. The computational complexity and efficient implementation of the algorithm are important in computing, and this depends on suitable data structures.. . Informally, the concept of an algorithm is often illustrated by the example of a recipe, although many algorithms are much more complex; algorithms often have steps that repeat (iterate) or require decisions (such as logic or comparison). In most higher level programs, algorithms act in complex patterns, each using smaller and smaller sub-methods which are built up to the program as a whole. In most languages, they are isomorphic to functions or methods.. . The concept of an algorithm originated as a means of recording procedures for solving mathematical problems such as finding the common divisor of two numbers or multiplying two numbers. The concept was formalized in 1936 through Alan Turing\u0027s Turing machines and Alonzo Church\u0027s lambda calculus, which in turn formed the foundation of computer science.. . Most algorithms can be directly implemented by computer programs; any other algorithms can at least in theory be simulated by computer programs.. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm. . An algorithm (pronounced AL-go-rith-um) is a procedure or formula for solving a problem. The word derives from the name of the mathematician, Mohammed ibn-Musa al-Khwarizmi, who was part of the royal court in Baghdad and who lived from about 780 to 850. Al-Khwarizmi\u0027s work is the likely source for the word algebra as well. . A computer program can be viewed as an elaborate algorithm.

The discovery and use of the right algorithms, and clever implementations and application are building blocks upon which the whole field takes collective steps forward. In our world of limited processors and limited storage there is a dire need for this art. It is through this remarkable skill that we can attempt unimaginable feats like decoding the human genome, routing millions of packets across networks, and even searching the entire internet.

        "answer": "From my class notes for Computer Science classes I teach:. . What is an Algorithm ?. . The most fundamental concept in computer science is that of the algorithm.  An algorithm is a set of steps that defines how a task is performed.  It\u0027s just a fancy word for a step-by-step method for solving a problem.  It doesn\u0027t even have to apply to computers or programming.  The way you tie your shoes or brush your teeth in the morning or perform a card trick are algorithms.  Of course, the word \"algorithm\" in the computing world implies that we\u0027re working with computer programs.  The study of algorithms and their development actually traces its roots to mathematics, long before computers were around.  Formally, an algorithm is a finite set of instructions having the properties of  Precision (steps are precise statements), Uniqueness (steps are uniquely defined), Finiteness (algorithm comes to completion at some point), Input, Output and Generality (steps apply to a general set of inputs.)  . . What is a program ?  . . So a list of instructions, apart from any computer, is an algorithm.  If we then take that algorithm, and code it into some computer language, we end up with a program.  A program is the implementation of an algorithm, written in some programming language.  This also answers the question, \"What is a programming language ?\"  A programming language is just some method of representing an algorithm in the code and syntax of that language.  Any artificial language that can be used to define a sequence of instructions that can be executed by a computer is a programming language.  The ones you may have heard of include Basic/VB, C, C++, Java, and Fortran.  We can also answer the question, \"What is programming ?\"  Programming is the art and science of developing algorithms and then making good programs out of them.  How about, \"What is a programmer ?\"  A programmer is an individual who writes and debugs computer programs.  A programmer might work alone, or might be a part of a whole programming team.  A programmer might be involved in the whole life cycle of a project or may only be responsible for one small piece of the puzzle.. . There is a common set of steps for creating a program:  We will just introduce the concept here.... . 1.Develop the program logic to solve the particular problem.   (Develop the algorithm.). 2.Write the program logic in a specific programming language.  (Coding the program.). 3.Assemble or compile the program to turn it into machine language that the computer can directly understand.. 4.Test , verify and debug the program.. 5.Prepare the necessary documentation.. . The algorithm logic is the most difficult part of programming.  Writing the language statements is relatively easy once the solution has been developed.  However, regardless of how difficult the program may be, documenting it is considered the most annoying activity by most programmers.  But it\u0027s no less important than the other steps.",

With 2 ½ inches separating our two eyes, each eye views an object from a slightly different angle. For instance, if you hold up a flower and look at it with just your right eye, the image is different from the image of when you look at it with just your left eye. The right eye sees more of the right side of the flower while the left eye sees more of the left side of the flower. If you placed the two different images on top of one another, they would not match and our vision would be out of focus. However, our brains sort out these varying visual messages from our two eyes, combines the images, and the recreates one three-dimensional image. . . This is referred to as binocular vision. Just like your look through two lenses in binoculars, humans view the world through two lenses. The eyes of many other animals are placed differently than ours. Many birds have an eye on each side of their head. Each eye sees a completely separate area stretching out on the left or the right.",

When he barks, it gives him a small shock.  Now when he starts barking, all I have to do is pull it out and ask him if he wants to wear it.  I have no problems now with getting him to quit barking.  It is not cruel to put these types of things on your dog.  I even shocked myself with it to make sure it wouldn\u0027t hurt my dog.  It is more of a surprise to them when they get shocked by it.  One of these collars is no different than a hunting collar, except it cost a lot less.. Putting your hand on the dogs mouth or giving it extra attention is not going to train your dog not to bark.  Using the bark collar and being consistent with making your dog be obedient will make a big difference.. Whatever you do, do not hit your dog with anything.  Your dog needs to know that he/she can trust you.  Also, you should never put your hand in your dogs mouth.",

        "answer": "Sales and marketing are totally different. To succeed in today’s marketplace, it is critical that you have a clear understanding of the difference or I guarantee you it will cost you, and cost you big..  . What’s the Difference? .  Sales is what you do when you are one on one with a prospect. Sales is the scripts you say, the techniques you use to drive home a point or persuade a person to write an offer or to sign a listing contract. You read a prospect’s buying signs, then adjust your response to the prospect and the situation.. . Understanding the difference between sales and marketing is essential to effective lead generation, and Greg’s expertise on this subject can be a tremendous asset to your career. . . Sales.  . Most agents are well trained in one-on-one selling. They memorize the scripts; if a prospect says “x”, then they respond with “y”. Agents are taught to focus on the customer’s needs, sell the benefits, ask “yes” questions, send up trial closes and then make sure to close at least five times; if they still have not signed, go back and start over with more benefits. This is the classic sales mentality that most agents have been indoctrinated with. Agents spend countless hours learning, practicing and perfecting their sales skills. . Once agents start to feel confident in their sales skills, they start looking at everyone as a potential prospect. They start to believe that if they are a good enough sales person, they can sell anything to anyone. I remember reading an old sales book that said, “a great sales person could convince people to buy things that they never heard of, never wanted, would never use, yet still make a prospect feel like they had made a wise decision to buy.” I constantly run into agents that with great pride tell me that they have a 90% or 95% closing ratio. This is all fine and good. Having great sales skills gives you a powerful advantage in the marketplace. The problem I see is when an agent’s sales mentality starts to creep into their marketing materials..  . Marketing, Defined .  Marketing is what you do to attract prospects before you meet them face-to-face. Marketing is stimulating a prospect’s interest and desire so that they what to buy in the first place. Personal marketing is not only stimulating interest, it is doing it in a way that makes the prospect want to buy through you. Great personal marketing creates a steady flow of people who are interested in working with you, so that when they call you they are already predisposed to working with you.. . The key difference you must understand is this: what makes a great one-on-one sales presentation is not the same thing you can use to make great marketing materials. So many agents take their very effective one-on-one presentation, put it on paper and call it marketing. Marketing starts by reaching out and grabbing a prospect’s attention by capturing a reader’s imagination. This is best done with a strong, emotional appeal that draws a reader along, getting them to imagine what it would by like to have a new home.. . Think about this way: What if a guy decided he wanted to get married, so he developed a list of all the benefits he had to offer a prospective wife? He then wrote that list of benefits on paper and sent it out to 1,000 single women. What kind of response do you think he would get? This is like putting a sales presentation on paper and calling it marketing. It simply does not work. Marketing is an attraction process that creates interest that gets a steady flow of dates coming your way. Not everyone is a perfect fit, but when you have a steady flow of new prospects coming your way, your chances of success go up significantly. .  . What to Do? .  So, you have come to the realization that you have been using too many sales pitches in your marketing materials. What now? . Start by just looking at your marketing materials. Do they look great? When you’re looking good, you attract more atten",

Atoms differ in the number of each of the subatomic particles they contain. The number of protons in an atom (called the atomic number) determines the element of the atom. Within a single element, the number of neutrons may also vary, determining the isotope of that element. The number of protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus may also change, via nuclear fusion, nuclear fission or radioactive decay. The number of electrons associated with an atom is most easily changed, due to the lower energy of binding of electrons.. . Atoms are electrically neutral if they have an equal number of protons and electrons. Atoms which have either a deficit or a surplus of electrons are called ions.

Trust me, I\u0027ve seen fabulous to absolutely TERRIFYING tattoo jobs. Just depends on the persons personal preference. Also, a lot of us girls have busy schedules and no time to play with make-up. So, it only makes sense. It\u0027s not an option for everyone. And you WILL have to continue twee zing your brows even AFTER getting them tattooed. Just because they are tattooed doesn\u0027t mean your hair will stop growing. Especially for those girls who have the tattooing just to fill in their thin haired (not thin shaped) brows.

The vast majority of plastics are composed of polymers of carbon alone or with oxygen, nitrogen, chlorine or sulfur in the backbone. (Some of commercial interest are silicon based.) The backbone is that part of the chain on the main \"path\" linking the multitude of monomer units together. To customize the properties of a plastic, different molecular groups \"hang\" from the backbone (usually they are \"hung\" as part of the monomers before linking monomers together to form the polymer chain). This customization by pendant groups has allowed plastics to become such an indispensable part of 21st-century life by fine tuning the properties of the polymer.. . . The development of plastics has come from the use of natural materials (e.g., chewing gum, shellac) to the use of chemically modified natural materials (e.g., natural rubber, nitrocellulose) and finally to completely manmade molecules (e.g., epoxy, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene).",

Father Christmas is a well-loved figure in the United Kingdom and similar in many ways, though the two have quite different origins.

Santa is a variant of a European folk tale based on the historical figure Saint Nicholas, a bishop from present-day Turkey, who gave presents to the poor. This inspired the mythical figure of Sinterklaas, the subject of a major celebration in the Netherlands and Belgium (where his alleged date of death is celebrated), which in turn inspired both the myth and the name of Santa Claus.. .

Normally, blood runs from each atrium to the ventricle in the same side and from their, blood will be pumped out of the heart to go either to the lungs (from right side) to the entire body (from left side). In this circulation pathway, there are 4 valves, which control the blood flow in the correct direction. One valve is located between each atrium and its corresponding ventricle. Therefore these valves are called \"Atrioventricular valves or simply AV valves.” The valve that located between right atrium and right ventricle is also called Tricuspid valve (cusp is referred to each section or leaflet of the valve, since this valve has three cusps or leaflets, it is called tricuspid). The valve that is located between the left atrium and left ventricle is also named \"Mitral valve\" and it has only two leaflets or cusps (therefore, you can call it bicuspid valve). There are two more valves that are located at the exit site of ventricles. On the left side, the valve is located between left ventricle and the Aorta and is called \"Aortic Valve.” On the right side the valve is located between right ventricle and the pulmonary artery and is called \"Pulmonary Valve.” These aortic and pulmonary valves also have three leaflets or cusps. . Sometimes, due to a congenital abnormality, the aortic valve will develop only two cusps and that is called \"Bicuspid Aortic Valve.” This congenital problem may be silent until advanced age but under certain circumstances it will develop heart problems.",

In 2004 Congress passed a law requiring the 3 credit bureaus to give every one a free copy of their credit reports once a year.. . That site is www.annualcreditreport.com.. . ALL OTHER SITES CHARGE YOU!!!. . Now about credit scoring.. . The only score that lenders use is a FICO score. This is a computerized scoring model developed by Fair Isaac Company. The consumer site is www.myfico.com. You can learn from the developers how credit scores work. If you are willing to pay $44.85 you will be able to get all 3 of your FICO credit scores at www.myfico.com/12. Plus you will get the top 4 reasons for each of the 3 credit reports as to why your credit scores aren\u0027t higher which will give you a game plan. Getting your scores this way will not impact your credit score but going to a mortgage broker/bank and applying for a mortgage will impact your score.. . FYI, for keysfunding and all of you here is the disclaimer on myfico for their credit scores.. . *About FICO scores and credit reports. FICO scores are the credit scores most lenders use to determine your credit risk. You have three FICO scores, one for each of the three credit bureaus - Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax. Each FICO score is based on the information that each credit bureau keeps on file about you. As the information in each of your credit reports change, your credit scores tend to change as well. When you purchase your FICO scores and credit reports from myFICO, you are getting a snapshot that is accurate at the time of your purchase. However, it\u0027s important to note that as the information in your credit reports changes, your FICO scores can also change. That\u0027s why we recommend checking all three of your FICO scores and credit reports regularly - at least once a year. . . One note, if you apply for a car loan at a car dealer there is a good chance that they will be using an \"Auto Enhanced\" FICO credit score. Since they are in the auto loan business this FICO score puts more emphasis on your handling of auto loans/leases. It will be higher if you have handled your current and past auto loans well and tends to be lower if you have not handled your current and past auto loans well. I recently financed a new car and my \"auto enhanced\" FICO score was 28 points higher than my FICO score. I also have 2 current and 5 past auto loans/leases on Equifax that are showing paid on time. My wife\u0027s \"auto enhanced\" score was 5 points lower than her FICO score because she is only showing the 2 current auto loans and one paid and closed lease on Equifax.. . . I hope this clears up some questions.. . Good Luck",

For simplicity, let us consider a point particle with mass m rotating about a given axis.  The system can be generalized as the sum over all point particles to understand the system.  This particle rotates about the axis at a radius of r with a frequency w.  It is known that the rotational kinetic energy of this particle is . . T(rot) \u003d .5*m*(w x r)^2 . . [for w x r as vector cross product].  By a mathematical identity, this is . . T(rot) \u003d .5*m*{w^2*r^2 - (w . r)^2} .        . [where w . r is the dot product].  This can be expressed as in component form to give you a 3 by 3 matrix for I [in 3 dimensional space] called the inertia tensor.. . T(rot) \u003d .5 * sum(ij)[ I(ij) * w(i) * w(j) ].

For an elementary treatment when the particle is always only moving in a direction that is perpendicular to the axis of rotation, this inertia tensor will only have diagonal elements and a scalar I is described where I \u003d sum(ij)[I(ij)] which is the moment of inertia you are familiar with.  Now,. . T(rot)\u003d.5 * I * w^2. I \u003d m * r^2. .

Here are some tips you could try to keep your skin healthier and thus prevent acne: . . *Avoid excessive sun exposure (although it will initially improve acne, consistent sun exposure will increase pluggin of your pores and make acne worse). *Avoid over-washing your face (limit washing to 2/3 times per day). More than that aggravates your skin and leads to increased oil production. Also avoid products with alcohol, they overstrip your skin of natural oils and make acne worse. . *Don\u0027t pick you skin...EVER. Picking your skin forces bacteria deeper into the pores and makes acne worse.

The most traditional clinking is when all glasses come together at once in the center of the group. When everyone’s glass has touched you then take a drink to seal the toast. When a toast is being made between two individuals it is important that, as their glasses clink together, the person giving the toast look into the eyes of the person being toasted. I know it’s difficult but rather than look at where your glass is going, it’s nice to look at the people that you’re toasting with. One style of toasting, that I like above all others, is that of sending the clink around the table. The presenter makes the toast and then turns to the person at their side and clinks their glass. That person then follows by turning to the guest next to them and the clink is passed on from guest to guest until it makes its way back to its origin. And then everyone takes a drink. . . In the past superstition tells us that some people believed that if they drank too much the devil would claim their souls. The clinking of glasses was thought to make noise to scare off the demons. . . I rather like to think of clinking as a pleasant form of celebrating conviviality. So raise your glass and just let it kiss the rim of your guest’s glasses in celebration of good friends and good wine.",

It has a firm, orange-colored center similar in texture and taste to peanut brittle (without the peanuts), that is coated in milk chocolate. The filling has a peanut butter taste, hence the name. When eaten, it tends to crumble and then take on a peanut buttery consistency.. Butterfinger was invented by the Curtiss Candy Company of Chicago, Illinois in 1923. The company held a public contest to choose the name of the candy bar. The name is a slang term used to describe a clumsy person, often in sporting events to describe an athlete who can\u0027t hold onto the ball. As an early publicity stunt and marketing ploy, the company dropped Butterfinger and Baby Ruth candy bars from airplanes in cities across the United States which helped increase its popularity.. One of the slogans currently used to advertise the candy bar is \"Break out of the ordinary!\" Prior to that, Bart Simpson and other characters from The Simpsons appeared in numerous advertisements for the product from 1989 to 2001, with the slogan \"Nobody better lay a finger on my Butterfinger!\". Butterfinger was withdrawn from German shops due to consumer rejection when it was one of the first products to be labeled as containing genetically modified ingredients from corn.. After a series of mergers and acquisitions, the candy bar is now produced by Nestlé.",

Nowadays there are several good translation in English of the Holy Quran.. . Despite the differences in the teaching of Islam and Christians, there are some similarities. To Muslims, Islam is the completion of the teaching of Jesus. That is why some may find the answer to the question they are seeking in the Bible but cannot find it, they find it in the Quran.. . Some similarities in Islam:. 1. Islam teaches it\u0027s followers to believe that Jesus really exist and Jesus is the messenger of God.. . 2. Muslims believe in the story of Adam and Eve (but with different understanding. For example, Muslims believe human beings do not carry the burden of the sin committed by Adam \u0026 Eve. In fact Muslims do not consider that Adam had committed sin by eating the apple. He was actually tricked by Satan. Hence, he did not intentionally want to eat the forbidden fruit). . 3.

How is it possible to fit the ENTIRE universe in a marble?. . The Big Bang theory suggests that the origin of the universe began as a singularity - a primeval atom. If the universe actually did begin as a primeval atom, where did it come from? And if the primeval atom did exist as a singularity, how is the Big Bang mathematically possible if 1+0\u003d1?. . Which means that if the primeval atom exists as a singularity and there is nothing else to add to it, then shouldn\u0027t the universe still exist as a primeval atom according to this mathematical principle?. . And if such a primeval atom exploded the universe into existence, how could it consist in the first place if it existed as a singular instability? - which means that the singularity was unstable and blew up (if this is the case, how long was it stable and what caused the instability if it existed as a singularity and there was nothing else there to unbalance it)?. .

Do you REALLY think that is physically possible?. . If E\u003dmc2 is the conversion of light energy into matter, and all matter consists of energy...then all matter originally consisted as light.. .
