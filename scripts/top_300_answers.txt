Most colleges look at GPA and class rank.  Also, most high schools multiply earned AP gpa by a multiplier to reflect additional difficulty.  For instance, a B in an AP class in my school was a 3.96 vs a 4.0 for an A in a standard class.  In that case, the AP class is probably better.  I'd like to think that more selective colleges take a more holistic approach to admissions, though I have no evidence of this, as I got a budget priced state school education.  (and a darn good one at that!)
I used to work in a college admissions office for a major university and they used a specific formula for calculating GPAs. They did this to put everyone on an even playing field - so that high schools that don't weight AP classes differently would be measured the same as those that do. Though I don't remember the specific calculation anymore, I definitely remember that AP classes were given a higher score. I'd suggest you take the AP class and try for the best grade you can get - because ultimately it'll be weighted higher at the college/university you are interested in, giving you a better chance of getting in!
It depends, if you take/took any adanced classes in middle school or junior high, they would probably be easy. That is not always true, for me I was in an at-risk program in tenth grade and am now in AP classes that are easy, and I have friends who took Honors classes and struggle with AP classes. So, i guess I'm saying that the answer is a very firm and definite maybe.
try to get honors and ap classes also buisness classes would not hurt, it really depends on what your feild of study is going to be.
u will have to approach the office there & ask them the procedure for admissions. which class are u seeking admission for, the earlier u register a child better it shall be.
AP stands for "Advanced Placement". I don't know what the other one stands for, but AP is better because if you pass a test at the end of the course, you could get college credits from a high school class.
Do u take AP chem? my class hasn't got that far
you get better food in business class not the crap in a plastic bag in coach class
A GPA > 4.0 means it has been weighted to give more credit for AP (advanced placement courses). So if you get an A in an AP class that is a 5.0.
Take plenty of math and science - all sciences. Of course health classes. If your HS has any physiology, kinesiology and anatomy AP classes take them too.
AP--Advanced Placement--was developed as a way to get bright and motivated high school students more challenging work. Taking the AP classes supposedly gives kids more academic work, greater challenges, and extends learning past the typical high school class. If you take the AP exams--standardized examinations--and get above a certain score then colleges accept this as "credits" toward college subjects. Its not uncommon for students to come to college with 3-12 AP credits that let them skip introductory level courses in college.
take a class and get a tutor
alright your GPA is great, but that is not all they look at for honors...at least at my old middle school it was the grades you got in 8th grade for the separate classes like if you get all A's this year or really close to it you can take honors in every class.... . yup yup make sure to maintain that GPA it will definetly benefit you, and after some of those you might want to take AP because it gets yah some college credit....so if they offer pre-AP classes then you will want to take them they are weighted a little more than honors = )
Not very hard. Which so called "pre AP" classes are you thinking about taking?
in my state cali you have to have these classes called Ap classes and if you get an F it counts as a D and if you get a C it counts as a C and C as B and B as A and A is  has 5.0 or sometin like dat . . .                               WEST SIDE
go to honors classes you get an extra point. do community service, most high schools give you extra credits for that. you can also do an easy class so you can get an easy A
it depends. if you want to get into a strong, private college, try to take every class available and work your ass off. if you're shooting for a good UC, take mostly AP classes with honors. if you're doing anything below a UC or high state school, don't take too many, because you might burn out before college.
Pay attention in class and stop screwing around.  And get better grades.
because coverup is a class they had to take to get into office.
Basicly it is legalized greed, turns out that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer and the middle class split and go one way or the other. Or it could be what the ape man said.
write a lot. take classes. then get opinions on you writing. get a job in the field and then take it from there.
i find it easy and fun to excercise when i mix it up. try different classes, listen to music on an mp3 player when you jog. take a dance class or a step class.
Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Business Administration, Bachelor of Arts. The difference is, you take mostly the same classes for your major, but you have to take other classes to qualify for the degree.  For BA, you need foreign language, for BS more computer science (like 1-2 classes, not much) and math.  And the other guy was right, it does depend on the school.
I took it two years ago and didn't find it very hard (and I'd just taken regular US history cause my school didn't have an AP class).  It's totally fine to take the AP class and not the exam.  However, I'd recommend taking it because if you do well that's great and if not you don't have to report it to colleges.
take something easy like a gym or a basic health class or if your school has like a cooking class or whatever. studying never hurt either
I THINK U SHOULD TAKE CLASSES AND THEM GET AN AGENT
Get a "gentle lead" and take your dog to dog obedience class.
Study for and get a GED first. Take a couple of classes at your local community college for a couple of semesters to get a feel of what college is like. From what I heard, the level of difficulty between community college classes and regular colleges/universities are pretty much the same even though community colleges often get stereotyped as being "easy".Try to find a community college with classes related to computer science to build up your skills.Take math classes too of course. Do very well and try to transfer to a college or university. Colleges and universities like to see an applicant that sincerely wants to get the most out of their education and can prove it by their transcripts. . . P.S. If you're trying for a 4 year-degree at a university/college, make sure the classes you take over at the community college can transfer over there as it saves a lot of time, money and headaches -especially General Education Classes. Tuition at community colleges is a lot cheaper so it's better to spend money on those classes there than at the university. Anyways, wish you luck!
It depends on how many AP Exams you want to sit through, don't forget that not only do they each take some cramming but each test is like three hours (or something like that) and usually the AP tests are all offered near each other. I have friends who are taking like 5 AP classes (of 6 classes) and they have to not only study for all of them, but they ended up having to take more than one on the same day...
advanced placement and international bacueluarete (i cant spell that...). most highschools only offer AP, i dont know a lot about the other one. i think IB is more like ALL your classes have to be IB classes, and AP you can take whichever ones you like, but im not sure.
I know where I go to school your GPA can be weighted by AP or dual-enrolment (college) classes.  That's the only way I know you can get above a 4.0.  Also, you don't have to get a 100% in all your classes to have a 4.0. You just have to have all A's.
Beacuase usually the republicans get in office and pass laws for the upper middle class and high class citizens. Democrats promise to take care of all citizens including the lower- middle class and lower class. Whether they do what they say- now thats questionable
Well, when you calculate your grade point average. In the Florida Orange County School System, an "A" is 4 points, a "B" is 3, a "C' is 2, and a "D" is 1. You add these numbers according to your grade in each class and divide by the number of classes. Many schools, however, use a "weighted" system which allows for a higher average. For example, an "A" in a regular class would give you a 4, but an "A" in an honors class would give you a 5. If you take six honors classes and get straight         . "A's" then you will end up with a 5.0 GPA. As for AP classes, an "A" will give you a 6. That is the highest you can get for an "A" in high school. For college, I cannot be sure as I am not there yet. I hope this is clear and helpful.
Just take a few college classes and get a better job.  . . The outsourced jobs are the customer service and factory jobs, jobs Americans weren't taking.. . The higher paying jobs are still here.. . Just ONE class at a jr college can make a huge difference in your paycheck.. . Good luck!
If you do well in any AP class, it's a good sign that you'll do well in whatever major you select.  Your question makes me believe that you're not sure what major you want.  I would suggest you start college undecided and take your general education classes (the required maths, sciences, humanities, etc for any degree), but select classes that fascinate you and fit the general education requirements.  From there you'll have a better idea what you have a passion for and you can then take all classes that are required for the major you select.
My best suggestion is to take a class.  They will usually supply lower power, easy to handle bikes, require little to NO riding experience, and you get 15% off of your motorcycle insurance when you pass.  I took a class to learn to ride, and I'm glad that I did.  Good luck!
He is trying to get the class to gang up on the troublemakers instead of taking responsibility for it himself.
I say, don't freak out on tests, get to know your professors well, see a tutor (they're not just for saving you from failing, a study group might also help if you think there are others in your position).. . Also don't feel bad about getting Bs.  (If you haven't yet you could take more exploratory classes and see if there is just something else you are better at).
You may not know all the answers, and if you do, they might teach different method of getting the answers. Class may seem too easy, but it will get harder eventually.
Take a safety class, get a back ground check, & pay a big fee. Check with the NA.
They will help you, but some will count for some college classes, cause i took caculous and they didn't counted for my college and also i took some AP class and it didn't trranfer cuase my spanish clases took place, so at times it could look good, but if it's not what u need for college dont take it couse you could be wasting TIME! so yeah and omg i feel so stupid for wasting it like that when at the end it was all bs i didn't need it.
when you are in high school, there arnt any specific cources u need to take for ur major. you should just take the classes that are given to you, and when u get into the university, there are specific classeds you must take.
Either . . a. go to college and take a C++ or Basic class. b. go to a local book store, get the book, study it, take the test, get the certification
convinence- no gas to get to class.
- excellent grades (top 5% or better in your class typically). - extracurriculars:  sports, music, clubs (e.g. drama, debate, math etc). - legacy within the family (immediate or relatives who are graduates). - attend Yale open house within your area (info available by contacting admissions office). - speak to your high school guidance counselor for advice. - ask Yale admissions officer for tips and get to know him/her
Oh, there's no telling what a high student is likely to do with a worm. Better get him sobered up before class.
well u need to take a driving class first. its easy as long as u pay attention to everything.
Try taking an acting class, joining toastmasters club, and volunteering, joining organizations. Get involved with people.
You have to go to college and get you bachelors in education. Try to take classes in social work.
I don't know if they let you know what your current grade in the class .  if they do think about getting that grade higher.. . Second. college is a business, if you do not get a good grade they d not care.  You will have to take the class over again and repay for the priviage.  Its your money that the professor gets if even if he has to teach the class to the same person twice.  also if you have a scholarship they do not pay twice for the same class.
Advanced Placement tests.  Often times, a good score on an AP test will transfer into college credit.  It's important to check at the college or university before taking the test to figure out the score you need to take to get the credit and if you'll get any credit at all (but I think most transfer).  This can be a wonderful way to get ahead in your college career by saving some money on credits and not having to take those classes in college!
I don't know if this is @ all schools, but you take an entrance exam and the scores that you get on the exam gives you a recommendation of what level classes you should take...but if you have 3.89 for the whole year, that's very good and most likely you'll get all honors classes.
Caffeine is your friend! . . Soda, Coffee, Amp, ... anything that has a lot of caffeine will help.. . Try and get enough sleep at night.. . In class make sure that you are warm or cool enough in class which will help the sleepiness somewhat.. . Good Luck! Sometime you will have to take those boring classes but when you get your degree it will be worth it.
get some experience,go to acting classes,thats wot im doin!. i think its better to go prepared!
Talk to your guidance councelor.  Most high schools now have kids fill out a 4 year plan for their high school class schedule based on their interests to give them a headstart in college.  The more AP CLASSES you take will also give you more credits for college.  My son wants to be a doctor and his guidance councelor reccomended that he take as many AP's as possible because after his freshman year in college he will have enough credits to be a junior the following year.  Our school is on a 5.0 grading system.  Hope this helps!  Good luck to you! Also summer school classes are a great way to get ahead too or if you have a tech or college near you,that is also beneficial to getting ahead before you start college. Talk to your GC though.  They will get you the answers you're looking for. Good job,thinking ahead also!
get a new class with a new teacher
u can't, get back to class
take a class. at the end of the class, they give you your lisence.
Take a speech class. It will help you speak in public and also works on grammar and proper annunciation. I think you would get alot more out os a speech class. Check it out.
Since you're in college, take a conditioning class or weight lifting class.  The instructor will be really informative, especially it's at a college level, usually requiring a doctorate degree to teach.. . Those type of classes are usually one unit, so it will save you a lot of money.  Plus you get credits!
Probally, I'm taking AP World and it's a lot of work. a class based on one part of history might be easier sense its focusing on one thing, but even so, it might focus in to the small details rather than a general over view like AP World.
take a class
take a class in it
Don't press your luck.  Smart-a** kids like you are the ones who make high-school miserable for the rest of us.  Keep your mouth shut and your hands to yourself, and think of how your actions could affect the rest of your class mates.. I had an Algebra teacher one year who was like that.  One day the smart-a** boys in the class (3 of them) showed up for class wearing devil's horns. She gave the entire class 100 functions to graph for the next day for a full test grade (on top of studying for the AP exams that SOME of us were taking the next day) to get even.  No one else in the class would talk to those guys for three weeks. It wasn't worth it!
take ESL classes @ a school or @ your local library offers free classes
Each grade is worth points: A = 4, B = 3, C = 2, D = 1, F = 0; taking AP classes? A = 5, B = 4 and so on. Add up all the grades and divide by the # of classes and you have a general idea of your GPA. Maybe there's a more "scientific" way to do it, but that's the most common.
take some classes to get your feet wet.  maybe join an acting group that performs.  and after you feel comfortable get an agent to help you get jobs.
Add 4 points for As, 3 for Bs, 2 for Cs, 1 for Ds, and 0 for Fs, then average it by dividing the sum by the number of classes you have...
Based on the grammar and spelling in your message, you would be much better served by taking a remedial English class.
Maybe it will select the students who  go to class, do the homework, read the text book, and study. As opposed to people who watch TV, smoke the weed, and hang in internet chat rooms. Admissions just select students with the potential, classes weed out the slackers. MIKE
I would get the class geek to do it for me.
Sue.  Get him fired or in some education classes.
Take a Spanish class
take a spanish class
take it to training classes
Take acting classes.
take an ESL class
Usually you need a minimum of a Masters degree except for math classes, in which case you can often get by with a BS.  You would go through Human Resources at the local school in addition to talking to someone in the department where you want to teach.
boy it must be hard living somewhere you cant even speak or understand the language. you should take a class to learn the language then you could get around better meet people or have you tried getting a pet something that will depend on you  then you have to get up and out
yea you should probably look into some kind of party planning job even if it's shitty, just to get experience, and I know they do have classes to take for being a wedding planner, and you would need to take some kind of business management type of class.
u can do this by using the concept of Singleton Classes. If u create a Single object for any Class, that object is called as Singleton Object. If u understand this concept ,its easy for u to create limited instances for any class.
what are you hoping to do with the education?. . if you NEED the degree, are you sure you need it? i mean, if a job is demanding that you get it, they should be willing to pay for some of it.. . if you're doing it in hopes of getting a job, there are better ways!. . if you just want to be educated, you can audit classes (especially at community colleges) for cheap. a college class will be less than a gym membership.. . student loans are pretty easy to qualify for, but you'll have them forever. make sure you're getting something that's worth the debt and the hassle!
Take your pick. 1.Lack of knowledge 2.Rebellious 3.Cut classes 4.Get on TV 5.All the above
Because it makes it easier for the rich to get richer and the poor to get poorer.  How are the middle and lower class supposed to compete with the 'slave' labor in China?  Hello free trade, good-bye middle class.
Yes, but a lot of employers don't value online degrees as much. It's getting better though. Some schools you can do part in the class and part online.
Take him to obedience classes
take a sexual education class.
Take a kickboxing or Karate class.
With all three of those classes at once, it's not going to be easy.  There isn't an easy way to do this.  But it is possible to do it without going crazy.  As hard as it may be with everything else going on in your life, you need to take all the opportunities you have to get help from your professors.  They're going to be able to answer your questions better than anyone else.  Pay attention in class - don't try to multitask.  Find one or two people (no more than two) that you can study with for all three classes.  Meet regularly.  This is a big help because you can support each other's weak areas and together identify the things that need a professor to answer.  Hope that helps.  By the way, this is from experience.  I didn't have all three at once, but I had chemistry last year, and I'm taking physics and calculus this year.
of course!....i had straight 4.0's in middle school..though did NOT take any honors classes....y?...well since i had no idea about that...well now, i'm taking my 4th honors class (economics) and i'm a senior in HS....... . ur gpa's is GREAT!.....my unweighted so far is 3.95 (i had my first B's in my junior year and yes....i'm trying to get away from that and maintain A's).....though my weighted in 4.06. . also, the best part about it is that as long as a class does not have AP, then it'll be weighted 5=A rather than a 4.. . i'm sure u'll do great.....=]
still gotta pay.  you take the class and they withhold judgement, if you dont get another in a year it goes away, off your record.
Most schools us this basic 4 point system for gpa.... A = 4. B = 3. C = 2. D = 1. F = 0. . You add all of your grades together, and divide by the number of classes you are taking.  By the way, this means that you should always drop a class if you can instead of failing it.  Even though in most colleges you would still have to pay for the class, a dropped class won't effect you GPA.  An "F," however, is devastating to a GPA.. . You also need to take into account how many credit hours a class is.  (This doesn't matter if you are in High School, or even if every single class is worth the same number of hours.)  For example, in most schools the standard class is 3 credit hours.  But most P.E. classes are only one credit hour, and some advanced classes are 5 credit hours.  In such a case some classes will have a greater effect than others.  In this case the easiest way to think of it is that if you have a 5 hours class and you get an A, you got 5 As.
We didn't get to that chapter in my math class yet...sorry
Well for one you can cuse them out, get up and leave during class, get up during class and make a fool of yourself, tell them no when they tell you to do something, and when they make you do something like take notes or do homework wrip it up and tell them no.
Some schools weight their GPAs so that honors or AP classes are worth more.  Instead of an A being worth 4 points it might be worth 5 points.
If you dont want to learn HTML let me suggest a software called DreamWeaver. I just learned this in a class I was taking and it's fairly easy to use.
- Get a sky map.. - Do some easy reading.. - Do some naked eye study of the sky.. - Get a pair of binoculars - telescopes at the .   beginning is not so good - not so easy to .   carry around - You may lose interest.. - Join some astronomy club.. - Attend classes, seminars, start parties.
You have to get professional photos taken and then take her to an agent and asked to be repped. Most likely the agent will tell her to take acting classes, but at least she'll be in the system.
democrats are for us middle class poeple and the poor,And republican are for the Rich poepl,When their in office the Rich get richer and the middle class has to struggle to stay Middle class,{Course they make it so we are poorer and when democrats are in Office middle class can Keep their head above water with bills as the saying goes and live comfortable and rebublicans can,t get our Money!{As much as when their in control!Hollywood
Geez, take a Civics class already.
umm take an english class lol
Try Taking a franklin covey class
take some class perfoming drugs
Take a public speaking or drama class.
by going to school and taking math classes..
yes if you take honors classes
Kick 'em in the "privates." . Get mouthy in class on a regular basis.. Nitpick and correct each and every grammatical misstep - this might be easier to do in your science or math classes than in your English classes, though it would have more effect in the English class.. . Now, why would you need to do such a thing?
Ask a vet, but maybe you should sign her up for obidience school classes. Going to classes like this can help get rid of common behavior problems.
figure it out yourself . listen in class. you'll be suprised how easy homework will b
mammal. . mam·mal (plural mam·mals). . noun . Definition:.  . class of warm-blooded vertebrate animals: a class of warm-blooded vertebrate animals that have, in the female, milk-secreting organs for feeding the young. The class includes human beings, apes, many four-legged animals, whales, dolphins, and bats.. . [Early 19th century. < modern Latin mammalia < Latin mamma "breast"]. . mam·ma·li·an adjective
Honestly you have to prepare to be a little bored.  Things to do to prepare is get plenty of rest each night before class, take a caffeinated beverage with you to class, take notes while the professor is lecturing(this will also help when it comes test time) and read along or highlight your book during lectures.
Your high school counselors spend a lot of time advising people about college admissions. Ask one. Your chances are better if you have a GPA of 4.1 (Grades in AP classes count 1 more than normal; "A = 5, etc) and 1400+ on the SAT.. . If you can hit the basket from center court 8 times out of 10, or run 40 yards in 5 seconds with two linebackers hanging onto you, you just have to be able to spell your name.
This way they can gauge if they are giving you enough information or not enough in their classes.  In university it could be to check what the students thought the class was about.  The course blurbs sometime don't get across what specifically the class is focusing on and if your expectations are wildly different, the professor can tell you and potentially save you $ on a class you'll hate!
Take classes that interest you - i.e. - in highschool i painted and sculpted alot...so taking art classes instead of statistics made school more tollerable
You're college will make sure you choose the right classes.  Of course, you will have to take the core classes:  english, algebra, chemistry, etc.  You also have to take the nursing related classes:  pharmacology, biology, psychology, anatomy, nutrition, etc.
simple because the wealthy are just getting richer and the poor are just getting poorer and the middle class have disappeared
you have to take a class and pass a test on bieng a flight atttendent i think the class lasts about 4 weeks???
With everything is is always a few horor stories, often it is people who did not read all of thier contracts, were expecting something that was not realistic.. . But they are most likley one of the better schools of thier type. They also have physcial schools, and offer in school classes, evening classes, and weekend classes, and thier online classes
uhm i dont know what "vaginal secretion" is but for the anger thing, take a anger management class. or just get a punching bag to releese your anger.
one word: prerequisites.. . she'd have to go back to school and take all the required science classes. she'd get miserable scores on the MCATs with no science background.
a boring class you hav to take at school?!?!?!
You should take a spelling class first.
Take a class in public speaking. It worked for me.
You could always take a speech class.
it is if you take some technical classes while there
well I'd say that depends on your personal style of learning.  To use distance learning (the internet, not satileite tv) obviously it will be best if you're a verbal learner or visual as you will basically be reading and completing modules.  If you are a better social or audio learner you may get friends to take the class with you so you can discuss the class or maybe read the lessons outloud to yourself or even tape record them.
I have to work and take one class per semester. (night, day, online) It may take a while but i'll get there. You can only do what you can do. Try getting a grant .  the website to go to is www.fafsa.ed.gov
Try getting a tutor. talking to your guidance counselor. If the counselor doesn't take you seriously have every one in your class take turns going to talk to them about the problem..
i think if will get admission in premier colleges like iit's and iim's then there are tailor made loans by sbi which are very easy to get but in scholarships it is very difficult to get all the money you need during your education
Did you get this question in your science class at school? Go hit the books!
do something really outrages in one of the classes, that way you get kicked out!!!!!!!!!
If you donate it to a school for their auto shop classes you can get a tax deduction.
If u live in Malaysia.....u can get a Malay teacher to sponsor yr class.
I am a working class citizen, I am also republican. Most republicans and working class people are also Christians. It makes sense. I am very much for Bush, but more for the voting against the horrible, and getting Bush, then getting him.
My school has about 195 kids and we have, maybe, 20 teachers. So 10 to 1. Some of my classes have hardly any kids in it. Like my AP Calculus class. But there are some schools, like in Chicago where I'm sure the ratio is about 25 to 1.
Don't take full time credits in college. Take evening classes.
Take acting classes for 10 years.  Call the community theaters in the city where you live and ask if they teach acting classes, or, know where you can take classes.  You can also call the theater department of the universities and ask them for acting school referrals.
art classes.  Architects have to take more art appreciation type classes while engineers take lots more math classes.  But, basically yes, the architect designs the building to achieve its purpose and the engineer makes sure materials used can keep it structurally sound.
drafting, math (geometry, trigonometry, etc.), physics, and shop classes too - i guess.. i didn't take any shop classes though..
Go to the class where they take your  official attendance. For me it was my 3rd period class, then leave, and you will be marked present for the whole day.
Just as the nae suggests a wrapper class is used to encapsulate another class. If for example you want to hide something in a class you just use a wrapper class to box the confidential class so that other classes cannot access it. Also when you need to add some functionality to a class and the classes inheriting from it then you can wrap the entire class heirarchy into a wrapper class that has the specified functions and/or members.
Graduate . Take classes . Go to collage . Interview people
It's time for you to take a philosophy class at a local college.
I would take accounting classes if i was you!!!
Class 1 is up to 2,000lbs. Class 2 is up to 3,500 lbs. Class 3 is up to 5,000lbs. Class 4 is up to 7,500lbs Class 5 is up to 14,000lbs.
1.Neither can not be initanitiated. 2.Abstract class can have defined methods. . If you have an abstract class with no defined methods, you're better off using an Interface.
Get enough sleep the night before. Drink some orange juice right before class. It gets into your bloodstream quicker than anything and will create a period of alertness. Of course, it will probably be followed by a sugar crash later. . . If you are falling asleep in class, it means you aren't getting enough rest.
definately english compostion classes and reading analysis classes, as well as socialogical classes and most likely some sort of pscycology class.
well 4 school keep notebooks and folders for every class, make sure only yhe work 4 that class is in that classes notebook/folder.A daily planner is helpful also. As for ur room, get plastic boxes for ur stuff and seperate it all. Once u do it then keep on top of it.
Depends on what year you are. . . My junior year, enrolled in 7 classes of which 5 were AP or Honors courses.... . Currently, enrolled in 7 classes as a senior, i've since then reduced to 3 AP courses.... . so i chose a lighter workload for my senior year...you might want to do that too. Besides, its only just a little more work and at a faster pace...if you can keep up, go with it.
Janitorial University. It will be a tediouse tenior. You will be taking classes such as Toilet scrubbing 101, and a chemistry class that will go over cleaning supplies to NOT mix such as amonia and bleach!
Do not sacrifice the whole class for the disruptive student.  Write him/her up without delay,  daily if you have to.  Get them out of the class.  I had a parent to remove her child from our high school and told me to my face that she was doing it "so that others could learn.". Some teens do not want to learn, they do not want to be there.  It would be better for that student to go get his/her GED and get on with life.
they don't, a bachlors degree normally takes 4 years or 8 semsesters to complete. But its bassed on a number of credits, that are earned by passing a class. If you wanted to finish early, take more classes.
In different manners.  The first contact with Indians was by a better class of European. They managed to get along  OK.  Later, dealings scoundrels and greedy men without honor, like President Jackson,  were disastrous for the Indians.
They are both equally important. You need the confidence to succeed in education. To take the classes you want and to have the condfidence to get a good grade reflects on who you are. The confidence also helps you to take the risks.
I believe UC no longer considers Affirmative Action for enrollment. If you are denied admission to UCLA but you have above average GPA and test scores- as compared to their incoming freshman class- then I would consider appealing.
I'm in honors biology and find the best way to pass the class is to read the chapter and UNDERSTAND everything you're reading. This usually takes me 1-2 hours to understand 10-20 pages. I know it sounds insane, but I ended up getting the highest score of my class with a final average of 104%
It's more complicated than that. It's a class thing. . . Tea is working class, served around 5 pm and this is normally the evening meal.  Working class people refer to the MID-DAY meal, i.e., 1 pm , as dinner. . . For the wealthier, Dinner is more like 8pm, once daddy gets home from the office etc. More for your upper class types. . . This is how it is in Scotland but nio doubt there are regional variations.

Maybe because an honest, hard working, middle class American wouldn't want so much of his hard earned money taxed to pay for entitlements and wasteful social programs. I also take issue with your claim that the middle class has always had it better under democrats. Not true.

Get a lawyer. People from that state are involved in a class action suit. It is the largest suit of its kind.
I would say 15, at least here in Indiana.  That way you can get your permit and practice until you are 16, then take the test and get your license when you turn 16. Or 30 days later, as I think it is here in Indiana.  Call to find out what age you can take the written and driving test, count backwards from there to see when you can take the Drivers Ed class.  Then again, each Drivers Class may have it's own guidelines.
You don't suck at life.  You are living and breathing just fine.. . You just need to get out more.  Take a class at the local community college and learn something new.. .

As a bonus, you will meet others that are interested in your new hobby!
Teachers determine if you pass your class or not. It's always best to be wary and not necessarily be teachers pet, but rather, attempt to get them on their good side. Trust me. It's easier to do a class if everyone follows the teacher correctly.
Now a days instructions for computers and computer software is rather easy, its just a bother to read. So, take the time to read them...OR you could take a computer class at the community college they usually slow paced. Good Luck!
You need to pass the licensing exam in your state before you can call yourself a real estate agent, so the best way to start would be enrolling in classes that prepare you for the state exams. Any local realtor can tell you where to go for these classes, and you can also check with the local community college. Just taking the classes does not get you a license, though; you'll still have to sit for the exam.
You just need to get confirmed.  Talk to the religious education director for your parish so you can get enrolled in the appropriate class.
I used to live in the Bible Belt and it is not just Christians. The population is more of a lower class in finical status and may not be able to afford better education. Plus people in the south or more rooted to there ancestors way of life. Getting married and getting a job and having kids are more to the front then getting an education and a career.
Well I know for sure in my area the teachers do not help the children if they do not under the assignment given to them. When they ask the teacher for help in the classroom, the teacher tells them they should have paid attention. They do not take control of there class rooms these days, it seems like they are more into just getting the classes done and over with here in my area. This is why I feel that teachers are not getting the respect.

The biggest thing is that you're not going to be the big man anymore.  The Seniors are kind of in charge, but it's still fun to find a senior or junior friend here and there.. . Classes usually aren't that much harder unless you CHOOSE harder classes.  You do get more homework in some classes, but less homework in other usually - so it evens out.
Chosing Interfaces vs Abstract Classes in not an eithier or choice, consider for example , if your applications functionality is likely to change in future then you could probably define the methods in an interface and let the functionality be defined by the class that implements the inteface,and thereby still maintain compatablity after revision, but on the other hande lets say, in case you want to write a class that forces a certain behaviour, ie , the behaviour remains constant, then you are better of defining it as an abstract class. Abstract classes are excellent ways to create planned inheritance hierachy, and remember a class that creates an abstract method can also call that method.. As a rule try to remember, if you are into creating API's then interfaces are the choice , on the other hand if you are building something like an application framework, consider using abstract classes to force certain behavioural characteristics,into all classes that extend your abstract class and let that class define the rest.
Well, sometimes you can try out for a play at your college. You can take all the drama classes and either get a minor in acting or a double major. Also, when you finish school, you can get an agent.

Take some babysitting classes. They teach you how to connect with the kids. Also just act like a kid when you are watching them. Don't get on a powertrip, just be cool and play with them.
I really sympathize with you.  You HAVE to get enough sleep, for starters.  It can be hard to get classes around your work hours, too.  I took out loans for my last two years (EDIT - and didn't work), because it was so hard.. My sister worked her way through in 3 years by taking extra classes, but worked less hours and had NO money to spare.. Good luck.
Organizational Behavior is a class where they teach you things that are completely obvious.  I learned absolutely nothing new from the OB class that I took in Business School.. . The only valid reason to take the class isbecause it is required.. .

Black Americans are viewed as lower class, because they were slaves.  They refer to Black Americans as cotton pickers.  They're just jealous.  They have to worry about getting eaten by lions, while you watch TV and work and get paid and relax.  Americans are just better, no matter. their color.

Check with your local colleges and universities. Most have a licensure only program for those who already have a degree. But you will need to take enough classes to earn a BS to teach. There are some Education colleges on-line, don't know of any that are certified though. Checking with a local college or university that offers an Education major is a good start.
A virtual function allows derived classes to replace the implementation provided by the base class. The compiler makes sure the replacement is always called whenever the object in question is actually of the derived class, even if the object is accessed by a base pointer rather than a derived pointer. This allows algorithms in the base class to be replaced in the derived class, even if users don't know about the derived class.. . ///

I graduated with honors and rarely went an entire week without cutting a class or two.  I could have graduated summa cum laude if I hadn't but *shrug*. . Cutting classes, on average, will harm you.  However it will vary from person to person.  Getting the material in class whether from the professor's website or a buddy is what is important.  You can teach yourself from there.
Business class is just a description the airlines invented to replace what it really is: 2nd class.  It's nicer than Coach (3rd class) because the Business class seats are wider and are located ahead of Coach.  If your flight is going to be very long, Business class may be worth the extra cost since it's more comfortable.
Object Oriented Programming is an idea in programming. You create objects in your code, by classes, which you can call and customize to suit your needs. . . Example: You are writing a program for a car dealership. You create a Car Class/Object that your program can use and reuse over and over again. . . ---------Car Class. . Public Class Car.     Private color As String.     Public Sub New().         color = "No Color".     End Sub.     Public Property CurrentColor() As String.         Get.             Return color.         End Get.         Set(ByVal Value As Int32).             color = Value.         End Set.     End Property. End Class. . . ---------Main. Car1 = New Car. Car1.CurrentColor(“Green”). . Car2 = New Car. Car2.CurrentColor(“Red”). . . --------. This is a very baisc example, hope it helps
Think about it:  With the incomes of the rich skyrocketing and the incomes of the working class and the poor plummeting, it won't be long before the middle class in the US disappears.  The middle class built this country, and carries it and keeps it afloat.  Ask yourself:  Where does the middle class come from?  It comes from the poor and the working class working hard, getting educated, starting businesses and supporting organizations (trade unions, etc.) that help us all.  The rich, for the most part, are parasites on the rest of us who carry their tax burden and let them get away with a free ride.  The only rich people who are any good are those who use their vast wealth for charitable purposes and who use it to create more possibilities for the enrichment of those who cannot yet buy it for themselves.
It allows you to gain AP Credit (which may carry over as college credit, though rarely as GPA-altering quality points).  It is also a good way to aquaint highschoolers with the level or work and critical thinking skills expected of a college freshmen.

You can go to an online drivers ed program that costs about $60 and complete the course, then go to your local DMV and take a test that if you pass you get your permit. Or you can enroll in a class that is over a weekend and then take the test after the class. Once you have your permit you have to have it for 6 months before you can get your license.

you may want to contact a company to see if they can use you.. They will get you set up with classes that you will have to take and pay for on your own..

My husband just got his insurence license and he didnt need a 4 year degree.
As far as getting experience and getting hired, it's best to sub for awhile. Not only does this get you experience, you will get to see if this is really what you want to do. Some districts also have full time tutors, and in my district, a BA or BS in the subject is all that is required. I won't sugar coat this, subbing is not for the weak. But if you do well, it gets noticed and you have a better chance of getting hired. Depending on the state you should be able to sub with a BA or BS.

To overcome this problem, first of all drink some alcohol then go to class, u will surely get energy and confidence.

Probably your are having difficulties with that class because you are not interested in that subject or because the teacher does not explain his/her lectures well...whatever the reason is, You can do some things to improve your grade. . . 1. Try to get a tutor about that subject or stay after class and speak to the professor, He/She may be able to explain things better.. . 2. Don't be absent, you could be miss out important information even by being absent one day. . . 3.Try to get good notes in class and maybe get a voice recording so that you can review the lesson when you feel confused about something.. . 4. Find friends in your class, you could get together study and discuss the problems that you're having in class.. . 5.Asking for extra credit may be a good choice but not every professor gives it. You also may want to explain him your situation and He/She may offer you some kind of help like extra homework or extra questions in tests etc.... . Last thing never lose hope! always trust yourself and don't give up!!!
It depends on the state.  In some states, all you have to do is get hired at a pharmacy and get trained.  Some states you have to take a class.  I would suggest going to the closest pharmacy and talking to the pharmacist about it, they'll know exactly what you need to do.
Homework is an assignment to do work outside of class and bring it back.  There are also in-class assignments.

It's really sad how cruel people can act and abuse another person. you need to be alot more assertive with these idiots you can take a course and self esteem building.  Your teacher is an ahole and should not be the head of a class room.  You could try and find another class if nothing else works.  I would just tell them all to f off and get a life.
Inheritance offers classes to be defined with taxonomy, like is done when classifying plants or animals. . In simple words, objects of inherited classes refine the state and behaviour of its parent. In a scenario where parent class is performing a certain operation, the child classes should be substitutable.
All ABA law schools are three years for day and four years for evening classes.  You apply after you complete four years of an undergraduate degree, and you need a 3.5 GPA or better.  Then you take the LSAT and get a score of at least 155 for even the middle tier schools.  During law school, you go to class, read about 250 pages of cases per day, spend your weekends in the library, try to stay in the top 10% of the curved grades so you can get a job in the top law firms and then try to stay there so you will have a decent job when you graduate.  If you are not in the top 10%, you need to stay in the top 25% to get a job in any law firm - otherwise you start your own shop and hope that you get enough clients to pay your bills.  Not quick, never easy, and your loans will be with you for the next 30 years.
You must be talking about Southwest. Generally, to get an A boarding card, you have to check-in on line the night before. Only on the very lightest of flights will they still have As or Bs left at the airport. It is strictly by order of check in. The first 45 get A, the next 45 get B and the last 47 get C. Easy as pie.
