Most colleges look at GPA and class rank.  Also, most high schools multiply earned AP gpa by a multiplier to reflect additional difficulty.  For instance, a B in an AP class in my school was a 3.96 vs a 4.0 for an A in a standard class.  In that case, the AP class is probably better.  I'd like to think that more selective colleges take a more holistic approach to admissions, though I have no evidence of this, as I got a budget priced state school education.  (and a darn good one at that!)
It depends, if you take/took any adanced classes in middle school or junior high, they would probably be easy. That is not always true, for me I was in an at-risk program in tenth grade and am now in AP classes that are easy, and I have friends who took Honors classes and struggle with AP classes. So, i guess I'm saying that the answer is a very firm and definite maybe.
try to get honors and ap classes also buisness classes would not hurt, it really depends on what your feild of study is going to be.
I used to work in a college admissions office for a major university and they used a specific formula for calculating GPAs. They did this to put everyone on an even playing field - so that high schools that don't weight AP classes differently would be measured the same as those that do. Though I don't remember the specific calculation anymore, I definitely remember that AP classes were given a higher score. I'd suggest you take the AP class and try for the best grade you can get - because ultimately it'll be weighted higher at the college/university you are interested in, giving you a better chance of getting in!
you get better food in business class not the crap in a plastic bag in coach class
take a class and get a tutor
Take plenty of math and science - all sciences. Of course health classes. If your HS has any physiology, kinesiology and anatomy AP classes take them too.
Do u take AP chem? my class hasn't got that far
i find it easy and fun to excercise when i mix it up. try different classes, listen to music on an mp3 player when you jog. take a dance class or a step class.
Beacuase usually the republicans get in office and pass laws for the upper middle class and high class citizens. Democrats promise to take care of all citizens including the lower- middle class and lower class. Whether they do what they say- now thats questionable
u will have to approach the office there & ask them the procedure for admissions. which class are u seeking admission for, the earlier u register a child better it shall be.
go to honors classes you get an extra point. do community service, most high schools give you extra credits for that. you can also do an easy class so you can get an easy A
in my state cali you have to have these classes called Ap classes and if you get an F it counts as a D and if you get a C it counts as a C and C as B and B as A and A is  has 5.0 or sometin like dat . . .                               WEST SIDE
because coverup is a class they had to take to get into office.
Not very hard. Which so called "pre AP" classes are you thinking about taking?
take something easy like a gym or a basic health class or if your school has like a cooking class or whatever. studying never hurt either
take a class. at the end of the class, they give you your lisence.
Pay attention in class and stop screwing around.  And get better grades.
A GPA > 4.0 means it has been weighted to give more credit for AP (advanced placement courses). So if you get an A in an AP class that is a 5.0.
alright your GPA is great, but that is not all they look at for honors...at least at my old middle school it was the grades you got in 8th grade for the separate classes like if you get all A's this year or really close to it you can take honors in every class.... . yup yup make sure to maintain that GPA it will definetly benefit you, and after some of those you might want to take AP because it gets yah some college credit....so if they offer pre-AP classes then you will want to take them they are weighted a little more than honors = )
Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Business Administration, Bachelor of Arts. The difference is, you take mostly the same classes for your major, but you have to take other classes to qualify for the degree.  For BA, you need foreign language, for BS more computer science (like 1-2 classes, not much) and math.  And the other guy was right, it does depend on the school.
take ESL classes @ a school or @ your local library offers free classes
Well, when you calculate your grade point average. In the Florida Orange County School System, an "A" is 4 points, a "B" is 3, a "C' is 2, and a "D" is 1. You add these numbers according to your grade in each class and divide by the number of classes. Many schools, however, use a "weighted" system which allows for a higher average. For example, an "A" in a regular class would give you a 4, but an "A" in an honors class would give you a 5. If you take six honors classes and get straight         . "A's" then you will end up with a 5.0 GPA. As for AP classes, an "A" will give you a 6. That is the highest you can get for an "A" in high school. For college, I cannot be sure as I am not there yet. I hope this is clear and helpful.
convinence- no gas to get to class.
I THINK U SHOULD TAKE CLASSES AND THEM GET AN AGENT
Get a "gentle lead" and take your dog to dog obedience class.
Just as the nae suggests a wrapper class is used to encapsulate another class. If for example you want to hide something in a class you just use a wrapper class to box the confidential class so that other classes cannot access it. Also when you need to add some functionality to a class and the classes inheriting from it then you can wrap the entire class heirarchy into a wrapper class that has the specified functions and/or members.
Study for and get a GED first. Take a couple of classes at your local community college for a couple of semesters to get a feel of what college is like. From what I heard, the level of difficulty between community college classes and regular colleges/universities are pretty much the same even though community colleges often get stereotyped as being "easy".Try to find a community college with classes related to computer science to build up your skills.Take math classes too of course. Do very well and try to transfer to a college or university. Colleges and universities like to see an applicant that sincerely wants to get the most out of their education and can prove it by their transcripts. . . P.S. If you're trying for a 4 year-degree at a university/college, make sure the classes you take over at the community college can transfer over there as it saves a lot of time, money and headaches -especially General Education Classes. Tuition at community colleges is a lot cheaper so it's better to spend money on those classes there than at the university. Anyways, wish you luck!
take a class
take a class in it
Class 1 is up to 2,000lbs. Class 2 is up to 3,500 lbs. Class 3 is up to 5,000lbs. Class 4 is up to 7,500lbs Class 5 is up to 14,000lbs.
AP stands for "Advanced Placement". I don't know what the other one stands for, but AP is better because if you pass a test at the end of the course, you could get college credits from a high school class.
definately english compostion classes and reading analysis classes, as well as socialogical classes and most likely some sort of pscycology class.
write a lot. take classes. then get opinions on you writing. get a job in the field and then take it from there.
AP--Advanced Placement--was developed as a way to get bright and motivated high school students more challenging work. Taking the AP classes supposedly gives kids more academic work, greater challenges, and extends learning past the typical high school class. If you take the AP exams--standardized examinations--and get above a certain score then colleges accept this as "credits" toward college subjects. Its not uncommon for students to come to college with 3-12 AP credits that let them skip introductory level courses in college.
get a new class with a new teacher
u can't, get back to class
it depends. if you want to get into a strong, private college, try to take every class available and work your ass off. if you're shooting for a good UC, take mostly AP classes with honors. if you're doing anything below a UC or high state school, don't take too many, because you might burn out before college.
If you do well in any AP class, it's a good sign that you'll do well in whatever major you select.  Your question makes me believe that you're not sure what major you want.  I would suggest you start college undecided and take your general education classes (the required maths, sciences, humanities, etc for any degree), but select classes that fascinate you and fit the general education requirements.  From there you'll have a better idea what you have a passion for and you can then take all classes that are required for the major you select.
Take a Spanish class
take a spanish class
take it to training classes
Take acting classes.
take an ESL class
Since you're in college, take a conditioning class or weight lifting class.  The instructor will be really informative, especially it's at a college level, usually requiring a doctorate degree to teach.. . Those type of classes are usually one unit, so it will save you a lot of money.  Plus you get credits!
I don't know if they let you know what your current grade in the class .  if they do think about getting that grade higher.. . Second. college is a business, if you do not get a good grade they d not care.  You will have to take the class over again and repay for the priviage.  Its your money that the professor gets if even if he has to teach the class to the same person twice.  also if you have a scholarship they do not pay twice for the same class.
u can do this by using the concept of Singleton Classes. If u create a Single object for any Class, that object is called as Singleton Object. If u understand this concept ,its easy for u to create limited instances for any class.
He is trying to get the class to gang up on the troublemakers instead of taking responsibility for it himself.
I took it two years ago and didn't find it very hard (and I'd just taken regular US history cause my school didn't have an AP class).  It's totally fine to take the AP class and not the exam.  However, I'd recommend taking it because if you do well that's great and if not you don't have to report it to colleges.
Just take a few college classes and get a better job.  . . The outsourced jobs are the customer service and factory jobs, jobs Americans weren't taking.. . The higher paying jobs are still here.. . Just ONE class at a jr college can make a huge difference in your paycheck.. . Good luck!
Most schools us this basic 4 point system for gpa.... A = 4. B = 3. C = 2. D = 1. F = 0. . You add all of your grades together, and divide by the number of classes you are taking.  By the way, this means that you should always drop a class if you can instead of failing it.  Even though in most colleges you would still have to pay for the class, a dropped class won't effect you GPA.  An "F," however, is devastating to a GPA.. . You also need to take into account how many credit hours a class is.  (This doesn't matter if you are in High School, or even if every single class is worth the same number of hours.)  For example, in most schools the standard class is 3 credit hours.  But most P.E. classes are only one credit hour, and some advanced classes are 5 credit hours.  In such a case some classes will have a greater effect than others.  In this case the easiest way to think of it is that if you have a 5 hours class and you get an A, you got 5 As.
Usually the art supply stores offer classes.  Most community colleges offer art classes and also the continuing education classes held at night offer art classes.
when you are in high school, there arnt any specific cources u need to take for ur major. you should just take the classes that are given to you, and when u get into the university, there are specific classeds you must take.
Caffeine is your friend! . . Soda, Coffee, Amp, ... anything that has a lot of caffeine will help.. . Try and get enough sleep at night.. . In class make sure that you are warm or cool enough in class which will help the sleepiness somewhat.. . Good Luck! Sometime you will have to take those boring classes but when you get your degree it will be worth it.
Take a speech class. It will help you speak in public and also works on grammar and proper annunciation. I think you would get alot more out os a speech class. Check it out.
Take him to obedience classes
take a sexual education class.
Take a kickboxing or Karate class.
advanced placement and international bacueluarete (i cant spell that...). most highschools only offer AP, i dont know a lot about the other one. i think IB is more like ALL your classes have to be IB classes, and AP you can take whichever ones you like, but im not sure.
I know where I go to school your GPA can be weighted by AP or dual-enrolment (college) classes.  That's the only way I know you can get above a 4.0.  Also, you don't have to get a 100% in all your classes to have a 4.0. You just have to have all A's.
Kick 'em in the "privates." . Get mouthy in class on a regular basis.. Nitpick and correct each and every grammatical misstep - this might be easier to do in your science or math classes than in your English classes, though it would have more effect in the English class.. . Now, why would you need to do such a thing?
Take a safety class, get a back ground check, & pay a big fee. Check with the NA.
My best suggestion is to take a class.  They will usually supply lower power, easy to handle bikes, require little to NO riding experience, and you get 15% off of your motorcycle insurance when you pass.  I took a class to learn to ride, and I'm glad that I did.  Good luck!
With everything is is always a few horor stories, often it is people who did not read all of thier contracts, were expecting something that was not realistic.. . But they are most likley one of the better schools of thier type. They also have physcial schools, and offer in school classes, evening classes, and weekend classes, and thier online classes
This way they can gauge if they are giving you enough information or not enough in their classes.  In university it could be to check what the students thought the class was about.  The course blurbs sometime don't get across what specifically the class is focusing on and if your expectations are wildly different, the professor can tell you and potentially save you $ on a class you'll hate!
I would get the class geek to do it for me.
Sue.  Get him fired or in some education classes.
Basicly it is legalized greed, turns out that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer and the middle class split and go one way or the other. Or it could be what the ape man said.
you have to take a class and pass a test on bieng a flight atttendent i think the class lasts about 4 weeks???
Geez, take a Civics class already.
umm take an english class lol
Try Taking a franklin covey class
take some class perfoming drugs
Take a public speaking or drama class.
by going to school and taking math classes..
yes if you take honors classes
You're college will make sure you choose the right classes.  Of course, you will have to take the core classes:  english, algebra, chemistry, etc.  You also have to take the nursing related classes:  pharmacology, biology, psychology, anatomy, nutrition, etc.
Try taking an acting class, joining toastmasters club, and volunteering, joining organizations. Get involved with people.
You have to go to college and get you bachelors in education. Try to take classes in social work.
A virtual function allows derived classes to replace the implementation provided by the base class. The compiler makes sure the replacement is always called whenever the object in question is actually of the derived class, even if the object is accessed by a base pointer rather than a derived pointer. This allows algorithms in the base class to be replaced in the derived class, even if users don't know about the derived class.. . ///
democrats are for us middle class poeple and the poor,And republican are for the Rich poepl,When their in office the Rich get richer and the middle class has to struggle to stay Middle class,{Course they make it so we are poorer and when democrats are in Office middle class can Keep their head above water with bills as the saying goes and live comfortable and rebublicans can,t get our Money!{As much as when their in control!Hollywood
well u need to take a driving class first. its easy as long as u pay attention to everything.
Democrats are stubborn and for the working classes Republicans are not able to forget and are for the business classes
Don't press your luck.  Smart-a** kids like you are the ones who make high-school miserable for the rest of us.  Keep your mouth shut and your hands to yourself, and think of how your actions could affect the rest of your class mates.. I had an Algebra teacher one year who was like that.  One day the smart-a** boys in the class (3 of them) showed up for class wearing devil's horns. She gave the entire class 100 functions to graph for the next day for a full test grade (on top of studying for the AP exams that SOME of us were taking the next day) to get even.  No one else in the class would talk to those guys for three weeks. It wasn't worth it!
Take classes that interest you - i.e. - in highschool i painted and sculpted alot...so taking art classes instead of statistics made school more tollerable
Ask a vet, but maybe you should sign her up for obidience school classes. Going to classes like this can help get rid of common behavior problems.
Because it makes it easier for the rich to get richer and the poor to get poorer.  How are the middle and lower class supposed to compete with the 'slave' labor in China?  Hello free trade, good-bye middle class.
Oh, there's no telling what a high student is likely to do with a worm. Better get him sobered up before class.
I don't know if this is @ all schools, but you take an entrance exam and the scores that you get on the exam gives you a recommendation of what level classes you should take...but if you have 3.89 for the whole year, that's very good and most likely you'll get all honors classes.
Chosing Interfaces vs Abstract Classes in not an eithier or choice, consider for example , if your applications functionality is likely to change in future then you could probably define the methods in an interface and let the functionality be defined by the class that implements the inteface,and thereby still maintain compatablity after revision, but on the other hande lets say, in case you want to write a class that forces a certain behaviour, ie , the behaviour remains constant, then you are better of defining it as an abstract class. Abstract classes are excellent ways to create planned inheritance hierachy, and remember a class that creates an abstract method can also call that method.. As a rule try to remember, if you are into creating API's then interfaces are the choice , on the other hand if you are building something like an application framework, consider using abstract classes to force certain behavioural characteristics,into all classes that extend your abstract class and let that class define the rest.
drafting, math (geometry, trigonometry, etc.), physics, and shop classes too - i guess.. i didn't take any shop classes though..
Go to the class where they take your  official attendance. For me it was my 3rd period class, then leave, and you will be marked present for the whole day.
It depends on how many AP Exams you want to sit through, don't forget that not only do they each take some cramming but each test is like three hours (or something like that) and usually the AP tests are all offered near each other. I have friends who are taking like 5 AP classes (of 6 classes) and they have to not only study for all of them, but they ended up having to take more than one on the same day...
Business class is just a description the airlines invented to replace what it really is: 2nd class.  It's nicer than Coach (3rd class) because the Business class seats are wider and are located ahead of Coach.  If your flight is going to be very long, Business class may be worth the extra cost since it's more comfortable.
a boring class you hav to take at school?!?!?!
You should take a spelling class first.
Take a class in public speaking. It worked for me.
You could always take a speech class.
it is if you take some technical classes while there
class I hitch, 1500 lbs.. . class II, 3500 lbs, but that's pushing it.
I dunno, but I loved drafting class, I was best in my class!
Ideally there is no diffrence between struct and class in C++ except that in struct, all members are public by default and in class they are private.. . class and struct are interchangeable. I would say, struct is into C++ just for compatibility with C.. . Prefer using class in C++.
Take acting classes for 10 years.  Call the community theaters in the city where you live and ask if they teach acting classes, or, know where you can take classes.  You can also call the theater department of the universities and ask them for acting school referrals.
art classes.  Architects have to take more art appreciation type classes while engineers take lots more math classes.  But, basically yes, the architect designs the building to achieve its purpose and the engineer makes sure materials used can keep it structurally sound.
Maybe it will select the students who  go to class, do the homework, read the text book, and study. As opposed to people who watch TV, smoke the weed, and hang in internet chat rooms. Admissions just select students with the potential, classes weed out the slackers. MIKE
its the class system. the society was divided into 3 estates or the class systems. the lower class had a lotta trouble and strife while the upper two classes enjoyed a lotta privelages and political immunity. . . plz vote if u like my answer

Homework is an assignment to do work outside of class and bring it back.  There are also in-class assignments.
Either . . a. go to college and take a C++ or Basic class. b. go to a local book store, get the book, study it, take the test, get the certification
It's more complicated than that. It's a class thing. . . Tea is working class, served around 5 pm and this is normally the evening meal.  Working class people refer to the MID-DAY meal, i.e., 1 pm , as dinner. . . For the wealthier, Dinner is more like 8pm, once daddy gets home from the office etc. More for your upper class types. . . This is how it is in Scotland but nio doubt there are regional variations.
well 4 school keep notebooks and folders for every class, make sure only yhe work 4 that class is in that classes notebook/folder.A daily planner is helpful also. As for ur room, get plastic boxes for ur stuff and seperate it all. Once u do it then keep on top of it.
Object Oriented Programming is an idea in programming. You create objects in your code, by classes, which you can call and customize to suit your needs. . . Example: You are writing a program for a car dealership. You create a Car Class/Object that your program can use and reuse over and over again. . . ---------Car Class. . Public Class Car.     Private color As String.     Public Sub New().         color = "No Color".     End Sub.     Public Property CurrentColor() As String.         Get.             Return color.         End Get.         Set(ByVal Value As Int32).             color = Value.         End Set.     End Property. End Class. . . ---------Main. Car1 = New Car. Car1.CurrentColor(“Green”). . Car2 = New Car. Car2.CurrentColor(“Red”). . . --------. This is a very baisc example, hope it helps
1.Neither can not be initanitiated. 2.Abstract class can have defined methods. . If you have an abstract class with no defined methods, you're better off using an Interface.
yea you should probably look into some kind of party planning job even if it's shitty, just to get experience, and I know they do have classes to take for being a wedding planner, and you would need to take some kind of business management type of class.
You may not know all the answers, and if you do, they might teach different method of getting the answers. Class may seem too easy, but it will get harder eventually.
Inheritance offers classes to be defined with taxonomy, like is done when classifying plants or animals. . In simple words, objects of inherited classes refine the state and behaviour of its parent. In a scenario where parent class is performing a certain operation, the child classes should be substitutable.
Based on the grammar and spelling in your message, you would be much better served by taking a remedial English class.

mammal. . mam·mal (plural mam·mals). . noun . Definition:.  . class of warm-blooded vertebrate animals: a class of warm-blooded vertebrate animals that have, in the female, milk-secreting organs for feeding the young. The class includes human beings, apes, many four-legged animals, whales, dolphins, and bats.. . [Early 19th century. < modern Latin mammalia < Latin mamma "breast"]. . mam·ma·li·an adjective
Interface vs. abstract class . Choosing interfaces and abstract classes is not an either/or proposition. If you need to change your design, make it an interface. However, you may have abstract classes that provide some default behavior. Abstract classes are excellent candidates inside of application frameworks. . . Abstract classes let you define some behaviors; they force your subclasses to provide others. For example, if you have an application framework, an abstract class may provide default services such as event and message handling. Those services allow your application to plug in to your application framework. However, there is some application-specific functionality that only your application can perform. Such functionality might include startup and shutdown tasks, which are often application-dependent. So instead of trying to define that behavior itself, the abstract base class can declare abstract shutdown and startup methods. The base class knows that it needs those methods, but an abstract class lets your class admit that it doesn't know how to perform those actions; it only knows that it must initiate the actions. When it is time to start up, the abstract class can call the startup method. When the base class calls this method, Java calls the method defined by the child class. . . Many developers forget that a class that defines an abstract method can call that method as well. Abstract classes are an excellent way to create planned inheritance hierarchies. They're also a good choice for nonleaf classes in class hierarchies.
Each grade is worth points: A = 4, B = 3, C = 2, D = 1, F = 0; taking AP classes? A = 5, B = 4 and so on. Add up all the grades and divide by the # of classes and you have a general idea of your GPA. Maybe there's a more "scientific" way to do it, but that's the most common.
Well, both are related to inheritance.. . Virtual functions are the ones which are declared in a base class and defined in derived classes. Virtual functions may be defined in the base class as well..    Use the keyword virtual to define such functions;.      virtual int fun( );.  . Pure virtual functions are not defined in the base class, they are only defined in (all) the derived classes. You can declare a pure virtual function as:.    virtual void fun( ) = 0;. . When a base class has a pure virtual function, it cannot be used to instantiate any objects. It becomes an abstract class.

A class is a class of IPs. IP addresses are either Class A, B, C, D, or E. If you use classless routing, youa re not using TCP/IP. An example of this is IPX/SPX protocol.
That's a very good question.  Why should the poor and middle class young people be fighting a war for the rich?  It does not make sense--it's as though, once again, the poorer classes are "servants" to the upper class.

Make your constuctor private.. Now have a satic integer variable 'i' which is initially=0. Make a  static function in which you call the private constructor, increment i by 1. check if i>0, dont call constructor and return a message that class cannot be instantiated.. These type of function is called factory function and this type of class is called singleton class
oh gee! all kinds of classes. freshman: english, science, speech. you will be taking all kinds of science classes all four years. you will have clinical experience, pharmaceutical classes, nutrition classes. i would also suggest going to the website of the college that you are interested in and find out the specifics there. every school is different. Good luck in your studies! Nursing is a very hard major.
The biggest thing is that you're not going to be the big man anymore.  The Seniors are kind of in charge, but it's still fun to find a senior or junior friend here and there.. . Classes usually aren't that much harder unless you CHOOSE harder classes.  You do get more homework in some classes, but less homework in other usually - so it evens out.
Bally's and 24 hour Fitness have classes.. . You can also see Bellydancing classes on "Fit TV".

I am a working class citizen, I am also republican. Most republicans and working class people are also Christians. It makes sense. I am very much for Bush, but more for the voting against the horrible, and getting Bush, then getting him.
The want a two class society, the rich elite and the "working joes".. . They don't want to expand the middle class, they want to eliminate it and make one HUGE lower class.  All while retaining their posotions of power and influence.
Take your pick. 1.Lack of knowledge 2.Rebellious 3.Cut classes 4.Get on TV 5.All the above
Teachers determine if you pass your class or not. It's always best to be wary and not necessarily be teachers pet, but rather, attempt to get them on their good side. Trust me. It's easier to do a class if everyone follows the teacher correctly.

It is the String representation of an object, generated by the toString method.  You likely got it by trying to print out an instance, perhaps in a System.out.print(ln) call.. . The toString method that is inherited from java.lang.Object simply prints out the name of the class with an index.  Generally, for his/her own classes, a programmer would override the toString method so that it returns a more appropriate String that describes instances of their class.
Do a demonstration infront of the class maybe by using a pair of scissors which they have especially because they use it on an art class.
Well for one you can cuse them out, get up and leave during class, get up during class and make a fool of yourself, tell them no when they tell you to do something, and when they make you do something like take notes or do homework wrip it up and tell them no.
It's your major coursework which leads to what you want to do with your life.  You must still take the basics such as History, English, and mathematics.

The most commonly discussed form is a contradiction arising in the logic of sets or classes. Some classes (or sets) seem to be members of themselves, while some do not. The class of all classes is itself a class, and so it seems to be in itself. The null or empty class, however, must not be a member of itself. However, suppose that we can form a class of all classes (or sets) that, like the null class, are not included in themselves. The paradox arises from asking the question of whether this class is in itself. It is if and only if it is not. The other form is a contradiction involving properties. Some properties seem to apply to themselves, while others do not. The property of being a property is itself a property, while the propery of being a cat is not itself a cat. Consider the property that something has just in case it is a property (like that of being a cat) that does not apply to itself. Does this property apply to itself? Once again, from either assumption, the opposite follows. The paradox was named after Bertrand Russell, who discovered it in 1901.
simple because the wealthy are just getting richer and the poor are just getting poorer and the middle class have disappeared

take some classes to get your feet wet.  maybe join an acting group that performs.  and after you feel comfortable get an agent to help you get jobs.
Honestly you have to prepare to be a little bored.  Things to do to prepare is get plenty of rest each night before class, take a caffeinated beverage with you to class, take notes while the professor is lecturing(this will also help when it comes test time) and read along or highlight your book during lectures.
you can use singleton class or you can use static variable as it is shared between all the objects of the class you can keep track of how many instances of that class has been created so far.
During compile time and runtime of a java program the classpath tells the javac.exe and java.exe where to find all the classes that will be used.  . . While running a class if another class is used that can't be found in any of the classpath entries, a ClassNotFoundException occurs.

Take your Driver's Ed classes (I recommend driversed.com, because it's online and you don't have to go to class), then apply for it. You'll have to take a written test at the DMV. If you pass, then they'll issue you one.
It is a class that you take, by yourself, where there is no set lecture time or anything like that.  You receive guidance from a professor, but are able to work at your own pace and set your own goals for the class.
My school has about 195 kids and we have, maybe, 20 teachers. So 10 to 1. Some of my classes have hardly any kids in it. Like my AP Calculus class. But there are some schools, like in Chicago where I'm sure the ratio is about 25 to 1.
in some of your low level college classes the classroom size is huge.  Teachers don't want to call out all the names so they pass around an attendance sheet.  You get a friend in that class and you guys alternate days of going to class the one who goes signs your name to the list in different ink and not right after their name all the time
The best thing I have ever done is the Pump classes by Les Mills.  You have to join a gym to get the classes.  It sounds like you need to build muscle( eat more protein) and something in the area of weight training.
Yes, but a lot of employers don't value online degrees as much. It's getting better though. Some schools you can do part in the class and part online.
Talk to your guidance councelor.  Most high schools now have kids fill out a 4 year plan for their high school class schedule based on their interests to give them a headstart in college.  The more AP CLASSES you take will also give you more credits for college.  My son wants to be a doctor and his guidance councelor reccomended that he take as many AP's as possible because after his freshman year in college he will have enough credits to be a junior the following year.  Our school is on a 5.0 grading system.  Hope this helps!  Good luck to you! Also summer school classes are a great way to get ahead too or if you have a tech or college near you,that is also beneficial to getting ahead before you start college. Talk to your GC though.  They will get you the answers you're looking for. Good job,thinking ahead also!
Get enough sleep the night before. Drink some orange juice right before class. It gets into your bloodstream quicker than anything and will create a period of alertness. Of course, it will probably be followed by a sugar crash later. . . If you are falling asleep in class, it means you aren't getting enough rest.

You need to pass the licensing exam in your state before you can call yourself a real estate agent, so the best way to start would be enrolling in classes that prepare you for the state exams. Any local realtor can tell you where to go for these classes, and you can also check with the local community college. Just taking the classes does not get you a license, though; you'll still have to sit for the exam.
Also try taking classes at a college that you could transfer to the university.  I don't know if there are community colleges in Ontario, but in the states taking classes at a community college and doing well in them is taken into consideration when you apply to a university.
Some schools weight their GPAs so that honors or AP classes are worth more.  Instead of an A being worth 4 points it might be worth 5 points.
of course!....i had straight 4.0's in middle school..though did NOT take any honors classes....y?...well since i had no idea about that...well now, i'm taking my 4th honors class (economics) and i'm a senior in HS....... . ur gpa's is GREAT!.....my unweighted so far is 3.95 (i had my first B's in my junior year and yes....i'm trying to get away from that and maintain A's).....though my weighted in 4.06. . also, the best part about it is that as long as a class does not have AP, then it'll be weighted 5=A rather than a 4.. . i'm sure u'll do great.....=]

good driving record,,, and some states if you take classes may take off points
I graduated with honors and rarely went an entire week without cutting a class or two.  I could have graduated summa cum laude if I hadn't but *shrug*. . Cutting classes, on average, will harm you.  However it will vary from person to person.  Getting the material in class whether from the professor's website or a buddy is what is important.  You can teach yourself from there.
Maybe because an honest, hard working, middle class American wouldn't want so much of his hard earned money taxed to pay for entitlements and wasteful social programs. I also take issue with your claim that the middle class has always had it better under democrats. Not true.
Sort answer:. to let the compiler/JVM know where your classes are stored.. . Long version:. The answer to this question can come from reasoning why no we need class names?!. . You need some way of telling the compiler, JVM, or even another class, where to look for code for a specific function.  Thus you need a unique name for a class, so that you can distinguish it from the rest of the code.. . So now that you can uniquely identify a class, how do you ensure that no other person developing code uses the same name for their class that you used for yours. Well, the answer to that is "packages".. . Now, in a big enterprise class system, there tends to be lots of classes and packages. You will organise them in various folders. Usually this can be more than one folder. In such cases, you need to let the compiler and the JVM know what are the locations where you have stored the class files. To do that, you set all those directories in the classpath
All good answers so far but don't forget that the Bennetts were a lower class and Elizabeth and Darcy's relationship was not acceptable to some of his class.
attendance, grading, email to other teachers and parents, checking grades of students in other classes and compiling data from state standards to put on the district website. Forming committees and taking on-line classes. Researching and finding video-stream media to show the class. Ordering books and materials and creating our own power point presentations or downloading/ creating worksheets.
Call your local junior college and ask them if they are offering a Counseling Class. It is a class that truly helps you find out where your interests lie and how to meet that goal. Make sure you are clear about which class so they do not think it has to do with psychology. They test you so you can see where your strengths and weaknesses are. Even though this class will not count towards your major, it will be of a huge benefit to you. It is hard, as a young person, to know what you may want to do all of your life. Take the class. You won't be sorry.
they have classes.  you attend these classes for a certain number of hours and you receive a certificate allowing you to be a bartender.  check with your local tavern league to get pointed in the right direction.  they can tell you everything you need to know about it.
I'm in honors biology and find the best way to pass the class is to read the chapter and UNDERSTAND everything you're reading. This usually takes me 1-2 hours to understand 10-20 pages. I know it sounds insane, but I ended up getting the highest score of my class with a final average of 104%
It is not important to follow a plan in the day-to-day teaching of the class.  However, certain things need to be taught in order for the class to be accredited.. . I have had wonderful teachers that had no structure to their classes, other than an outline of which chapters we were going to be tested on.  We covered the material we had to, then we were allowed to ask questions about anything else regarding the class.
Obedience classes are good for a lot of reasons. They promote socialization. They also give you the foundation for future training. They will be able to teach you how to keep your dogs attention and even though you are going to class once or twice a week it is your responsibility to work with the dog in between on what he/she has learned in class. So I would highly recommend an Obedience class.

Think about it:  With the incomes of the rich skyrocketing and the incomes of the working class and the poor plummeting, it won't be long before the middle class in the US disappears.  The middle class built this country, and carries it and keeps it afloat.  Ask yourself:  Where does the middle class come from?  It comes from the poor and the working class working hard, getting educated, starting businesses and supporting organizations (trade unions, etc.) that help us all.  The rich, for the most part, are parasites on the rest of us who carry their tax burden and let them get away with a free ride.  The only rich people who are any good are those who use their vast wealth for charitable purposes and who use it to create more possibilities for the enrichment of those who cannot yet buy it for themselves.
You are NEVER too young to to spread the word IF you truly understand it, and you feel that the Lord is moving in you to spread his gospel.  Ignore the idiot that told you to take a biology class first.  The Word takes no biology class to understand and share.
